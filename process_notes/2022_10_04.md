- Worked on exploring the data in advance of chatting with LC Labs experts.
- Created EDA_Notebook.ipynb to explore the data and get a sense of what I want to do with it.
  - Did struggle a bit figuring out how to join the `metadata.csv` with the `manifest.txt` file but was eventually successful after the chat and exploring the fields.
  - Noticed that currently image location is set for the aws s3 bucket. Will need to change this to the local file path once I'm working with the data. 
- Overall found the README very helpful for what was included in the datasets. 
  - One suggestion would maybe provide an anecdotal example of how the data was collected from the original database, where you could explain how the data was generated similar to this example from the [Shakespeare and Company Project](https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/sources/cards/):

Next steps:
- work on understanding and visualizing the distribution of the data
- especially interested in digging into some of the more hazy MARC fields like location and subject headings
- also need to research image models a bit more to see what's out there and what might be useful for this project
