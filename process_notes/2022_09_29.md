Notes:
- Used the aws cli to get the data. 
  - Iâ€™ve actually never actually used it but it was very easy to do. The thing that was tricky was not being able to see what files where there in advance (might be worth putting it up on a website somewhere), but once I listed them it was pretty seamless. I decided to download all the data mostly for my interest but literally took maybe five minutes of googling to find the right command, so highly recommend! Used  these two resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/index.html> and <https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/aws-s3-download-folder>
- Secondary update: didnâ€™t realize how large these files are so now regretting downloading everything ðŸ˜…. Shouldâ€™ve just downloaded the index.html at the outset
- Third update: stopped the general download to just get the stereographs

Final update: 
Was able to get all the data and store it on my external hard drive ðŸ¥³
